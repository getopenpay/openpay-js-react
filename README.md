# openpay-js-react

React components for OpenPay.JS

## Development

1. Install dependencies using `make install`
2. Run `make dev` to start Vite in watch mode
3. In another terminal, `cd` into the `example` directory and run `make dev` to start the example app
4. Open [http://localhost:3032](http://localhost:3032) to see the example app

When you make changes to the library, Vite will automatically recompile it and NextJS will automatically reload the page.

If NextJS doesn't reload, you can try manually refreshing the page, or reinstalling the library using `npm install ../` in the `example` directory.
